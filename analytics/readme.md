Complex brain activity can be decomposed into a combination of multiple sinusoid frequencies (which add up to create the complex brain activity). These simple frequency components tell us what patterns of activity are occurring across the brain â€“ such as slow wave-like increases and decreases, or fast and highly active patterns.

Shown below is an illustrative example of an arousal index. Multiple indices of arousal are advocated by different publications in scientific literature. Different indices are more responsive to various aspects of the arousal scale (e.g., tired/asleep, focused/engaged, or stressed). To provide as much information, in an unbiased way, we include all indices with acceptable scientific evidence, a description of each, and a grand average of all signals that provides a conservative overall indication of state.
